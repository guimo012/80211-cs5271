To keep things clear, I think changes to kernel source should go inside kernel/
and the modified files should have the same path with regards to the kernel
source tree. Keeping kernel changes under kernel/ allows us to expand later if
we want to modify or keep some other code in the repo.

I agree. It might not be the end of the world if we just put an entire kernel source tree in the repo. That way we can easily build a kernel for the client. We'll have to copy over whatever we need to the OpenWrt stuff -- not the end of the world.
And I'm just modifying this so I can get used to git... -jb

Name functions with a "cs5271_" prefix to make finding things easy later. After
that, follow the naming conventions of the kernel.
